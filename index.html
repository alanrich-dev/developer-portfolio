    <h2>My Story</h2>

    <p id="tp">TL;DR: I was a construction worker and taught myself to code by reading docs during my breaks and after work. My first IDE was a carpenter pencil and paper<br></br>One day I was bored so I decided I would learn how to code. I didn't have any particular reason, I just thought it would be interesting. No bootcamp. No tutorials. I learned by reading documentation, building mockups of sites I liked and hacking snippets of javascript on codepen.<br></br>
I wasn't looking for a career change, I was happily employed as a union electrician in Chicago. Then one day at work 600lbs of steel fell on me. I looked down to see the extent of the damage and it was gruesome. I went into shock. A few surgeries later I found out my days working as an electrician were over.<br></br>
I needed a new career so I spent the next year teaching myself web development. My learning curve was a series of sigmoidal curves. Their were weeks of rapid progress followed by weeks of total stagnation. Overcoming the stagnation requried learning and the material was interesting so I rarely felt frustrated. I enjoyed the process. There were times I felt overwhelmed, googled "coding bootcamps" and dreamed that forking over money would somehow make learning easier.<br></br>I couldn't justify spending money to learn something that could be learned for free. I read more docs and found they were accessible and well written. Which I found surprising because the youtube tutorials meant to appeal to people like me were full of industy jargon that obfuscated the material. I was shocked that the primary source material was the most readable. So with no education in CS I found that I could use complex tools like webpack bundler and understand what was happening under the hood simply by reading the instructions manuals.<br></br> About a year after I began, I realized I had a good understanding of ES6 and had developed familiarity with a growing list of ubiquitous technologies. I had even developed my own perference for javascript design patterns (factory functions). I was beginning to dive deeper into theory. I remember I was reading an article explaining the rationale for favoring composition over inheritance when I decided to compare myself to bootcamp graduates.<br></br>I went to a few bootcamp websites that publish student work. The students had apps that made simple API calls, showed CRUD functionality and manipulated the DOM. I had all that in my <a href="https://github.com/alanrich-dev">github</a> too, so I decided to make a portfolio and seek work. I also still had that $20k that I didn't waste on a bootcamp. So I relocated to the south of France.
