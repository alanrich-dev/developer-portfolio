I began coding javascript December 6th, 2020 with a basic understanding of html, css and data structures. After learning about javascript scope and closure I practiced with some design patterns; the object constructor and factory function.

I quickly shifted to writing code in a way that favors composition over inheritance. I heaviy favored factory functions. I found them to be a simple solution to the problem of namespacing. 

To keep my code readable, modern and concise I always tried to limit my use of loops and conditionals in logic. I manipulated data structures with higher order functions whenever possible. To be fair though, none of my projects were algorithmically demanding. Moving forward that is a challenge I would like to soon take on.

Once I had developed enough projects through the Odin curriculum to fill a portfolio I shifted my focus to Node, express and NoSQL. After completing my first express project I discovered BaaS. Once I discovered BaaS I put the Node learning on hold and put up my portfolio on firestore.
